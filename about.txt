// HOW IT ALL STARTED

Growing up in the church as a pianist, the music was awesome but I had an emptiness I didn't know how to fill. I looked for answers and couldn't find any. So I decided to try something different, I started fellowshipping with God through music, that was my game changer. One faithful morning while fellowshipping with God, I had an encounter that filled that emptiness the awesome church music couldn't fill. Then, I discovered the emptiness wasn't in the songs but from the song leader. I wanted to fix this. So, November 11, 2018, Alpha Gospel Breed, previously known as Gospel Breed was created and it wasn't out to raise up just song leaders, but worshipers who can create an atmosphere for God's people to fellowship with their heavenly Father through songs.

//OUR VISION

In this world of uncertainty and chaos, we seek to bring men and women back to the awareness of God's unfailing power in an atmosphere of heart-filled worship.

We are out to share the never-ending love of God that brings hope and peace through music. (Mark 16:15).

We are out to raise not just song leaders but worshipers who can create an atmosphere for God's unfailing power to be made manifest through music. (John 4:23).
