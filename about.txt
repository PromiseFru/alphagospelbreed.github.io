// HOW IT ALL STARTED

Growing up in the church as a pianist, the music was awesome but I had an emptiness I didn't know how to fill. I started engaging in worship songs and one day I had an encounter with the spirit of God that filled that emptiness the beautiful church music couldn't fill then I discovered the emptiness wasn't in the songs but from the singer. November 11, 2018, Alpha Gospel Breed, previously known as Gospel Breed was born and it aimed at raising up not just worship leaders but worshipers who can create an atmosphere for God's people to fellowship with their heavenly father. And that was the birth of Alpha Gospel Breed.

//OUR VISION

In this world of uncertainty and chaos, we seek to bring men and women back to the awareness of God's unfailing power in an atmosphere of heart-filled worship.

We are out to share the never-ending love of God that brings hope and peace through music. (Mark 16:15).

We are out to raise not just song leaders but worshipers who can create an atmosphere for God's unfailing power to be made manifest through music. (John 4:23).
